// What is the difference between ***var*** and ***let***?
A var can be reassigned, redeclared, mutate and it's a function scope.
A let can be reassigned and can be mutated, but it cannot be redeclread and it works in a block scope.

// What is the difference between **var** and ***const***?

Const cannot be reassigned, redeclared, but can be mutated. It is also a block scope. 
var can be reassigned, redeclared, mutate and it's a function scope.
